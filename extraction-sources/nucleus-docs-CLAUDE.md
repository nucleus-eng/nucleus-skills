# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## About this repository

Documentation for the [Nucleus Distribution](https://docs.nucleus.engineering) — a knowledge base of validated protocols and modular components for developing synthetic cells. Built with [MyST MD](https://mystmd.org/) (Jupyter Book).

## Development commands

**Setup (first time):**
```bash
./setup.sh               # Creates the nucleus-docs conda environment
conda activate nucleus-docs
```

**Local dev server** (live reload on `.md` and `.ipynb` changes):
```bash
jupyter book start
```

**Build HTML** (mirrors what CI does):
```bash
myst build --html
```

**Check for myst build errors** (what the `build-protocols` CI job gates on — see issue #176):
```bash
python3 scripts/build-protocols.py
python3 scripts/build-materials-reference.py
python3 scripts/check-myst-build.py
```
`scripts/check-myst-build.py` runs `myst build --html --strict` and fails only on ⛔️ errors (broken links, missing images, malformed directives) — ⚠️ warnings are summarized but never fail the build. Run the two generator scripts first: `guides/materials-reference.md` and every process page's Downloads cards reference gitignored `generated/` artifacts, and a build run without them reports those as real missing-file errors. Known false positives (currently: a figure sourced from a remote DevNote via `xref:`, which myst still checks for on local disk) are declared in `scripts/myst-build-false-positives.toml` — myst's own `error_rules` config can't scope this to a single file, since some rules carry no per-file key, so a `myst.yml`-level suppression would silently blind the check to a genuinely missing file anywhere else in the docs.

**Generate lab-ready protocol PDFs / BOMs** (requires `myst` + `typst` on PATH):
```bash
python3 scripts/build-protocols.py            # all processes
python3 scripts/build-protocols.py <dir>      # one process
python3 scripts/build-protocols.py --extract-only   # skip PDF rendering
```

**When verifying changes before a commit, only regenerate the process directories you actually touched** — pass the specific `docs/processes/<dir>` path(s) to `build-protocols.py`, not the bare command. Rendering PDFs for the whole site via `myst` + `typst` is the slowest step in local verification, and CI regenerates everything from scratch at deploy time regardless, so a full-site run adds no safety over a scoped one.

CI runs on pushes to `main` via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, installing `mystmd` via npm and deploying to GitHub Pages.

**QA checks** (run locally before opening a PR):
```bash
python3 scripts/check-dropdowns.py      # flag placeholder-only lists
python3 scripts/check-file-placement.py # flag content files outside allowed dirs
python3 scripts/check-toc.py            # validate myst.yml TOC entries
python3 scripts/check-dna-refs.py       # if you touched a Designs table: verify construct/bp claims against nucleus-eng/DNA
```

These run automatically on PRs via `.github/workflows/qa.yml` (which also runs Vale). Install pre-commit hooks to catch violations before pushing:
```bash
pre-commit install        # installs hooks (done automatically by setup.sh)
pre-commit run --all-files  # run all hooks manually
```

## Architecture

### Companion DNA repository

Sequence files for every plasmid and construct referenced in these docs are maintained in a separate repository: **[nucleus-eng/DNA](https://github.com/nucleus-eng/DNA)** (local path: `~/src/nucleus-eng/DNA`). That repo stores GenBank (`.gb`) files organized by part type:

```
DNA/
├── PURE/
│   ├── cloning/      # pOpen entry vectors for all PURE system proteins
│   └── expression/   # pET28a expression vectors for PURE system proteins
├── assembly/         # MoClo backbone (pOpen-pOpenv3-MCL0)
├── RBS/              # Ribosome binding site and UTR parts
├── promoters/        # Level-matched T7 promoter library (PURET7-1 through -10)
├── reporters/        # Fluorescent protein and chromoprotein reporters
├── terminators/      # T7 terminator variants
└── detectors/        # LacI/TetR circuits and quorum sensing components
```

**Checking the DNA repo's current state.** The DNA repo evolves independently — always verify its current state before writing or editing content that references specific constructs. Use a tiered approach:

1. **Session start** — when beginning any work that involves DNA construct references, check recent activity in the DNA repo:
   ```bash
   git -C ~/src/nucleus-eng/DNA log --oneline -5
   ```
   Commit messages will tell you if the structure or contents have changed since you last worked with it.

2. **Before naming a specific construct** — before writing a protocol step that references a construct by filename (e.g., `pOpen-PURET7-3`), confirm the file exists:
   ```bash
   ls ~/src/nucleus-eng/DNA/promoters/pOpen-PURET7-3.gb
   ```
   If the file is missing, flag it to the developer — do not invent construct names or create placeholder references.

3. **If folder structure is uncertain** — if you are unsure which subdirectory a part type lives in, read the DNA repo's README:
   ```bash
   # or: Read ~/src/nucleus-eng/DNA/README.md
   ```
   The README is maintained as the canonical description of the repo structure.

4. **If `~/src/nucleus-eng/DNA` is not on this machine** — use the GitHub API as a fallback to browse the repo or inspect construct files without cloning:
   ```bash
   # Browse a directory (e.g. detectors/)
   gh api "repos/nucleus-eng/DNA/contents/detectors" --jq '.[].name'
   # Decode a GenBank file and read the LOCUS line for construct length
   gh api "repos/nucleus-eng/DNA/contents/detectors/pOpen-LacI-IPTG.gb" --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep "^LOCUS"
   ```

**Key rules when working across both repos:**

- **Do not create or store `.gb` sequence files in nucleus-docs.** All DNA sequences belong in the DNA repo.
- **Construct names in protocol pages must match actual filenames** in the DNA repo (e.g., a step that says "use `pOpen-PURET7-3`" corresponds to `promoters/pOpen-PURET7-3.gb`). Verify before writing.
- **Cross-repo links** in doc pages should point to the GitHub URL of the `.gb` file in `nucleus-eng/DNA`, not to a local path.
- **Changes to the DNA repo are out of scope for nucleus-docs PRs.** If a construct referenced in a source page is not found in `nucleus-eng/DNA`, add an `:::{attention}` block in the spec noting the gap, e.g.: "Construct `pT7-aHly` is not yet in `nucleus-eng/DNA` (originated in `bnext-bio/nucleus`). Do not link to the legacy repo — flag for follow-up so the construct can be submitted to `nucleus-eng/DNA` before this page is used at the bench." DNA constructs referenced in a DevNote SHOULD be submitted to `nucleus-eng/DNA` before or alongside migration; if they are not present at migration time, apply the attention block and flag.
- **Construct↔file identity is a claim, not a guess.** Never place a construct in a Designs table because its name resembles a filename in `nucleus-eng/DNA`. A Designs-table row asserts *this is that sequence* — it requires evidence, minimally that the row's `Length (bp)` equals the target file's GenBank `LOCUS` length (`python3 scripts/check-dna-refs.py` checks this). If the source content's construct differs from the Nucleus construct in any way — tag, backbone, promoter, codon usage, species variant — that is **equivalence, not identity**, and belongs in the block below, never as a Designs-table row. This is the specific failure mode ("greedy linking") that motivated issue #120: a name-similarity match getting asserted as sequence identity.

  ```
  :::{attention} Nucleus equivalent — not the cited sequence
  The data on this page was generated with <cited construct> from <source>. The nearest
  Nucleus construct is [pOpen-X](https://github.com/nucleus-eng/DNA/blob/main/<path>).
  It is functionally equivalent but **not sequence-identical** (<the difference>).

  ```

### Terminology

These definitions ground the module/implementation content model below (`docs/modules/`, `docs/implementations/`, and their `spec.md` files):

- Composition (n): the physical make up of a system; typically concentration and spatial organization
- Composing (v): the act of combining two or more systems and their associated functions
- Component: an element (abstract or concrete) of Composition; a single part or piece of a larger whole. May be defined as having subcomponents.
- Function: a designed behavior; defined by and emergent from Composition
- Requirements: Functional or Compositional elements whose presence (or often absence) are required (and in specified amounts) in order for a system of a given Composition to demonstrate a designed Function
- Module: a component with specified Composition and Function (given certain Requirements).
- Specification: a concrete description of the Composition and Function of a system, as well as any Requirements on that system to Function as described
- Integration: the engineering work required to modify the Composition of two or more Modules such as to retain their Functions when composed.

### Content model

The documentation organizes content into three parallel hierarchies under `docs/`:

- **`docs/processes/`** — Step-by-step lab protocols. Each process lives in its own subdirectory with a `main.md` (or a named `*-main.md` for parent pages). Sub-protocols nest as children.
- **`docs/modules/`** — Modular components that extend base cytosol functionality. Each module has a `spec.md` describing its design, compatible processes, and usage.
- **`docs/implementations/`** — Documented combinations of modules and processes that demonstrate a complete system behavior.

**File placement rules.** All content files — `.md`, images, `.csv` resources — must live inside one of these three subdirectories. Never create content files or directories at the repo root or anywhere outside `docs/`.

| Content type | Correct location |
| --- | --- |
| New module | `docs/modules/<module-name>/` |
| New process | `docs/processes/<process-name>/` |
| New implementation | `docs/implementations/<implementation-name>/` |
| Process sub-resources (BOMs, images) | `docs/processes/<process-name>/resources/` |
| Module images | `docs/modules/<module-name>/` |
| Module raw assets (Notion/DevNote exports, source files) | `docs/modules/<module-name>/resources/` |

**Before creating or moving any file**, verify the target path matches this structure. If a file is about to land outside `docs/`, stop and flag it to the developer before proceeding.

**Manufacturer PDFs and datasheets must not be committed to this repo.** Reference them via vendor URLs or host them externally. Until a shared hosting convention is established, add a `<!-- TODO: replace with hosted PDF link -->` comment on the download card in the `# Downloads` section rather than committing the file. Do not include vendor PDFs in PRs.

### Table of contents management

The site TOC is defined entirely in `myst.yml`. When adding a new page, you must add it to the `toc:` section. Child pages that should not appear directly in the sidebar use `hidden: true`. The file `site.yml` holds site-wide settings (license, nav links, theme) that `myst.yml` extends.

**Adding a module spec requires two table-of-contents updates, not one.** In addition to the `myst.yml` TOC entry, add a row to the table in `docs/modules/modules-main.md`. The table columns are `Module Class | Specification | Validation` — fill in the class name (e.g. `Detector`), a relative link to the spec (e.g. `[LacI-IPTG](./detector-laci_iptg/spec.md)`), and the validation star rating (use ★ to ★★★ following the validation key at the top of `modules-main.md`: ★ = preliminary/DevNote only, ★★ = validated in cells or in vitro, ★★★ = frequently used). Missing this step leaves the module off the main module index page.

Note that `hidden: true` is used pervasively for *every* non-sidebar child page — it is a navigation setting, **not** a maturity signal. Page maturity is tracked separately via the `status:` frontmatter field (see below).

### Page status (draft / published)

Every content page has a maturity `status`, declared as a frontmatter field. This keeps stub or unvalidated pages from misrepresenting themselves on the public site without a heavyweight build-exclusion mechanism (issue #74; #57 may later add build-time exclusion keyed off this same field).

| `status:` value | meaning | TOC | banner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `draft` | incomplete; not ready for public consumption | must be `hidden: true` (keep out of the sidebar) | **Draft** banner (below) |
| `unvalidated-published` | complete and publicly visible, but not yet validated in the current Nucleus Cytosol | normal | **Not yet validated** banner (below) |
| `validated-published` | complete and validated; ready | normal | none |

- **Absent `status:` is treated as `validated-published`** — do not churn the ~50 ready pages. Only `draft` and `unvalidated-published` pages need an explicit field.
- **Templates ship with `status: draft`** so a new page can't accidentally appear validated; the author changes it to `unvalidated-published` or `validated-published` when ready.
- The `status:` field does **not** auto-render anything — add the matching banner by hand when you set `draft` or `unvalidated-published`. The two standard banners:

```
:::{attention} 🚧 Draft
This page is a work in progress and not yet ready for use.
:::
```

```
:::{attention} Not yet validated
This page has not been validated in Nucleus Cytosol. <optional specifics, e.g. "Expected performance data below is from PURExpress cells.">
:::
```

A page may also carry an unrelated content caveat (e.g. aHly's "not actively supported" BSL-2 note) — that is independent of `status:` and stays as its own admonition.

### Templates

`templates/` contains Cookiecutter-style starter files:
- `process-template/process-make_template.md` — full example of a process page including admonition blocks, protocol steps with checkboxes, and a Downloads section
- `module-template/spec.md` — module spec structure with schematic, designs table, compatible processes, and usage references
- `implementation-template/implementation-template.md` — combined implementation format
- `typst/nucleus-protocols/` — the branded typst template used to render lab-ready protocol/BOM PDFs (vendored in-repo; pubmatter pinned to 0.2.2 — see its README)

**When migrating content into a pre-created stub directory**, scan for and delete any template placeholder files before committing. Stub directories are often created with placeholder images (e.g. `behavior/ppk-kinetics.png`, `behavior/ppk-endpoint.png`) that have no real data and were copied from the implementation template. Run `git ls-files docs/modules/<module>/` to see what's tracked, and `git rm` any placeholders that have not been replaced by real figures.

### Lab-ready protocol pipeline

**Working on BOMs or the protocol pipeline** (`build-protocols.py`, `check-bom-labels.py`, `bom-<slug>` tables, download buttons)? Invoke the `build-boms` skill for the full pipeline spec and rules. One always-on rule: `generated/` is gitignored (`**/generated/`) — never commit PDFs or CSVs.

### Prose formatting

**Do not hard-wrap paragraph text.** Write prose paragraphs as a single line, regardless of length. Do not insert line breaks in the middle of a sentence or at an arbitrary column width. Hard wraps in `.md` files render as spaces in most contexts but create messy diffs and make future editing harder. This applies to instructional text in templates, overview sections, figure captions, and all other prose. The only intentional line breaks in paragraph content are blank lines between paragraphs.

`scripts/check-formatting.py` detects hard-wrapped prose and runs as a **warning-only** CI check (never blocks a PR). Run it locally to surface violations before review:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-formatting.py          # check docs/ and templates/ (exits 0 always)
python3 scripts/check-formatting.py --strict # exit 1 if findings found (for local enforcement)
python3 scripts/check-formatting.py docs/    # check a specific directory
```

### MyST syntax conventions

Pages use MyST admonition nesting with `:::` fences. Process pages follow a consistent structure:
1. Frontmatter (`title:`)
2. `# Overview` with an `:::::::{card}` block containing nested dropdowns for Notes, Prerequisites, Hazardous Materials, Critical Materials, Genetically Encoded Components, Composition, and References
3. `# Protocol` with `##` subsections and checklist steps (`- [ ]`)
4. `# Downloads` grid with cards linking to PDF lab protocol and Bill of Materials

Protocol steps use `- [ ]` checkboxes and `:::{hint}` dropdowns for extended notes. Cross-references use MyST `{ref}` syntax for same-page targets and standard markdown links for cross-page references.

**Internal links in inline HTML must use `.md` extensions, not `.html`.** MyST resolves internal links via the source `.md` paths. Using `.html` in an `<a href="...">` tag produces a 404 on the deployed site. This applies to all inline HTML links (e.g. version badges, quick-link pills) — always write `href="./path/to/page.md"`, never `href="./path/to/page.html"`.

**Tab-set fence depth.** Tab-sets require a consistent three-level nesting: the outer `{tab-set}` uses `:::::`(5 colons), each `{tab-item}` inside uses `::::` (4 colons), and figures or admonitions inside a tab-item use `:::` (3 colons). Mismatched colon counts are a common source of rendering failures.

**Secondary figures.** Within a section that has a primary figure (e.g. a performance plot), de-emphasize supplementary or supporting figures by wrapping them in a `::::{hint} <descriptive title>` block with `:class: dropdown`. The dropdown title should describe the finding, not just label the figure (e.g. `::::{hint} The Emitter Cell causes E. coli to express GFP in response to IV-HSL`). This keeps the primary figure prominent while keeping supporting context one click away. When there are multiple parallel secondary figures (e.g. the same experiment across several conditions), use a hybrid: a single dropdown wrapping a tab-set, so readers open one drawer and switch between conditions with tabs. The outer hint uses 7 colons, the `{tab-set}` inside uses 6, each `{tab-item}` uses 5, and figures inside use 3 — consistent with the tab-set nesting rules above.

**System-context figure placement (module specs).** A figure showing the module in the context of the Base Cell or Developer Cell belongs in the `## Cells` section, not `# Overview`. The Overview section should carry mechanism and schematic figures only.

**Composition table depth for composed modules.** Some module specs are themselves a composition of other modules — e.g. a chassis made of a cytosol and a membrane, a sensing cell made of a chassis and a detector, a cascade made of a sensing cell, an effector, and a reporter. For these pages, the default is to flatten the Composition/Reference table **one level deep**: list each direct constituent module as a single line item with its working concentration or fraction in the combined recipe (e.g. `Base Cytosol: <amount>`, `Chicago Membrane: <amount>`). Do not expand a constituent module further into its own sub-components (e.g. don't break Base Cytosol down into its ~100 individual PURE-system components on the composed page) — that level of detail belongs on the constituent's own spec page. The full composition is a mathematically well-defined, fully collapsible object all the way down to base components, so a page can show that full expansion if it is genuinely useful, but one level of flattening is the expected default for readability. Citation-only rows with no numbers are not sufficient — the direct constituents' working concentrations should always appear.

**Mass-to-molar conversions use the functionally active stoichiometry.** When converting a component's mass concentration to molarity anywhere in this repo (PMix, SMix, Ribosome, tRNA tables, or any future component table), use the stoichiometry of the protein or complex's **functionally active state** — not just whatever oligomeric state a reference database lists as its default or crystallographic annotation. A protein can assemble as a dimer or multimer in solution while sources annotate it inconsistently (e.g. a "Homodimer" structured field next to a free-text note saying "active as monomer"). When sources disagree, resolve using literature on the specific organism and context (e.g. E. coli, not a homolog from a different organism), and prefer solution-phase or functional evidence (sedimentation equilibrium, activity assays) over crystal-packing contacts, which can be non-functional artifacts. The goal is to represent the molarity of the active, functional component for modelers — not to mechanically copy a database's stoichiometry field. Two precedents from this repo's work:
- **E. coli MetRS** is a stable homodimer in solution; a "monomer" reference turned out to describe an artificially truncated lab construct, not the full-length protein. Use n = 2.
- **E. coli EF-Ts** appeared as a "homodimer" in one source, but that was a crystal-packing artifact (or a conflation with the genuinely dimeric *Thermus thermophilus* ortholog). Solution-phase evidence shows it is monomeric in E. coli. Use n = 1.

### Overview card dropdowns — empty dropdown policy

The template includes all possible dropdown sections as a starting point. **When authoring or reviewing a process page, only keep dropdowns that have real content.** Delete any dropdown whose only content is a placeholder (e.g. `- TODO`).

The process template uses `- TODO` as the scaffold placeholder — this is intentional so contributors know which sections need to be filled in. **`check-dropdowns.py` (and CI) will fail if any `- TODO`, `- None`, `- N/A`, or `- TBD` placeholder-only list survives outside `templates/`.** Before opening a PR, run:
```bash
python3 scripts/check-dropdowns.py
```

**When editing or reviewing a process page**, scan for empty dropdowns matching this pattern and flag them:

```
::::::{<type>} <Section Title>
:class: dropdown
:icon: false

- TODO

::::::
```

If you find one, flag it and ask the developer: **"The `<Section Title>` dropdown is empty — should it be deleted, or does it need content?"** Wait for confirmation before making any changes. Do not silently leave placeholder content in committed files, but also do not silently delete them. The template file (`templates/process-template/process-make_template.md`) is the only file exempt from this rule.

**If all dropdowns in the Important Information card are removed**, the containing card block should also be removed:

```
:::::::{card}
:header: **Important Information**

Please read this section carefully. It contains important notes, resources, and safety information. Not all information included here is included in the lab-ready protocol.

:::::::
```

Again, confirm with the developer before deleting the card.

### Content migration

**Migrating Notion or DevNote content?** Invoke the `migrate-content` skill — it has the full checklist: table indentation, aside/toggle conversion, DOI citation format, data-discrepancy flagging, scope boundary (spec vs. process), and more.

### External references

`myst.yml` maintains a `references:` map of named keys (e.g., `devnote-01:`) pointing to external DevNote URLs. These can be cited throughout the docs without repeating URLs.

### Citations and references

**Do not hand-write a `# References` section (or a References dropdown).** MyST's implicit-DOI feature auto-generates a single references section at the bottom of every page from the `https://doi.org/…` links it finds in the page content. A page that also hand-maintains a References list **double-renders** (the manual list *plus* the autogen block) — and because the DOI links often live only inside that manual list, deleting it would remove the references entirely. This was issue #101.

The convention:

- **Cite each source inline** where it is discussed, using a DOI link. Both styles are fine — pick whichever reads naturally:
  - Parenthetical: `…permits passage of small molecules ([Song et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.274.5294.1859)).`
  - Narrative: `As shown in [Bhatt et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c12491), the module functions in…`
- The inline link text (`Author, YYYY`) is just the in-prose anchor; the bottom references entry is built from the DOI's live metadata, so it is authoritative. **This surfaces stale citations** — if the inline text disagrees with the rendered entry (wrong author/year/DOI), fix it.
- **DevNotes with a `10.63765/…` DOI** must be cited via their `doi.org` link so they autogenerate like any other reference (a bare `doi:10.63765/…` text string does **not** trigger autogen).
- **Non-DOI sources** (DevNotes/articles with no DOI) stay as plain inline links for now; they will not appear in the auto-generated list until the `.bib` + `{cite}` work lands (issue #138).
- After editing references, run `myst build --html` and confirm the page renders exactly **one** `myst-bibliography` block with every cited source present.

### Prose linting (Vale)

**Run `git ls-files docs/ | grep -E '\.(md|csv)$' | xargs vale` before opening a PR or committing a content migration.** This command lints only committed source files (skipping gitignored `generated/` artifacts). Vale lints both `.md` and `.csv` files and runs as part of the `qa` CI workflow (`.github/workflows/qa.yml`).

```bash
git ls-files docs/ | grep -E '\.(md|csv)$' | xargs vale          # lint all committed docs (skips generated/)
vale --glob='!**/generated/**' docs/                              # lint full docs/ tree, excluding generated/
vale <file.md>                                                     # lint a single file
```

Vale rules live in `styles/nucleus/`. Current rules enforce temperature unit formatting (`°C`), micro symbol usage (`µ`), chemical notation (subscripts and ion superscripts), and unit spacing. Executable tests for these rules live in `tests/` (pytest, not content — run `python -m pytest` from the repo root).

**Interpreting temperature-related errors.** Temperature formatting is enforced by two overlapping rules: `nucleus.units` flags spelled-out forms (`degC`, `degrees C`, `degrees Celsius`, `deg C`) via substitution; `nucleus.degrees-symbol` flags bare digit+C patterns (`95C`, `72 C`) via a raw regex. Both fire as `error` level. In practice, `nucleus.degrees-symbol` currently has a known detection gap — bare `\d+C` patterns are not reliably detected (tracked by `vale-miss` annotations in `styles/tests/temperature.md`). Rely on `nucleus.units` for spelled-out forms; flag bare patterns manually until the gap is fixed.

**Interpreting `nucleus.degrees-symbol` errors.** When Vale flags a `nucleus.degrees-symbol` error, check the surrounding context:

- **Real error** — the token is a temperature value. Fix it by adding the degree symbol (e.g., `37C` → `37°C`, `4 C` → `4°C`).
  - Signals: preceded by "at", "to", "of", or a verb like "incubate", "store", "heat"; followed by "for X minutes/hours"; in a reaction table or thermocycler step.
  - **Table cells**: a bare value (e.g., `37C`) in a table column whose header indicates temperature (e.g., "Temperature", "Incubation temp", "Storage") is always a real error, even without surrounding signal words.
- **False positive** — the token is a label, not a temperature. Leave it alone.
  - Signals: preceded by "Figure", "Fig.", "Step", "Lane", "Panel", "Tube", "Option", or a similar structural label word.

**Interpreting `nucleus.chemical-notation` errors.** This rule flags molecular formulae and wavelength labels written with bare ASCII digits and suggests the correct Unicode subscript form. Always a real error — replace `OD600` → `OD₆₀₀`, `A260` → `A₂₆₀`, `H2O` → `H₂O`, `ddH2O` → `ddH₂O`, `MgSO4` → `MgSO₄`, etc. The rule is a substitution rule — the error message shows the exact correct form to use. There are no known false positives (the rule uses an explicit curated list of formulae rather than a generic pattern, so construct names like `pET28a` and labels like `A19` are unaffected).

**Interpreting `nucleus.ion-charges` errors.** This rule flags ion charges written with inline numbers rather than Unicode superscripts. Always a real error — replace `Mg2+` → `Mg²⁺`, `Ni2+` → `Ni²⁺`, `Na+` → `Na⁺`, `K+` → `K⁺`, `Mg++` → `Mg²⁺`, etc. Superscript characters: ⁺ (U+207A), ² (U+00B2), ³ (U+00B3).

**Interpreting `nucleus.micro-symbol` errors.** This rule flags patterns like `10 uL`, `500 uM`, or `2 um` that use an ASCII `u` instead of the micro symbol `µ`. Always a real error — replace with `µL`, `µM`, or `µm` respectively.

**Vale `TokenIgnores` limitation on CSV files.** Vale's `TokenIgnores` setting (used to suppress URL matches) works for `.md` files but is silently ignored for `.csv` files. This means URL-encoded sequences like `%2C` in CSV cells can trigger rules even when URLs are listed in `TokenIgnores`. The workaround is to bake URL safety directly into the rule pattern (e.g., `(?<!%)\d+\s*C\b` instead of `\d+\s*C\b`).

**Applying fixes programmatically.** When using a script (e.g., perl/sed) to bulk-apply degrees-symbol fixes, always use a negative lookbehind for `%` to avoid corrupting URL-encoded sequences like `%2C` (comma):

```perl
# Safe — won't corrupt %2C, %3C, etc. in URLs
s/(?<!%)(\d+)C\b/$1°C/g

# Unsafe — will corrupt URL-encoded sequences
s/(\d+)C\b/$1°C/g
```

Do not add Vale inline suppression comments (`<!-- vale off -->`) without confirming with the developer first. When suppressing only a specific rule (e.g., to silence BOM product-name false positives), prefer rule-scoped suppression over a blanket `<!-- vale off -->`:

```html
<!-- vale nucleus.magnitude-unit-spacing = NO -->
:::{table} Bill of Materials
...
:::
<!-- vale nucleus.magnitude-unit-spacing = YES -->
```

**Canonical unit list.** Several Vale rules share an overlapping set of recognised units. Vale rule files are self-contained YAML and have no native include or variable mechanism, so the lists are duplicated by design — the rules differ slightly because false-positive risk varies by context. The canonical reference list (for human consistency checks, not machine enforcement) is:

| Domain | Units |
| --- | --- |
| Length | `nm`, `µm`, `mm`, `cm`, `km` |
| Volume | `µL`, `mL`, `L` |
| Mass | `µg`, `mg`, `g`, `kg` |
| Concentration | `nM`, `µM`, `mM`, `M` |
| Molecular weight | `Da`, `kDa` |
| Time | `s`, `min`, `h`, `d` (SI); `yr`, `mo` (non-SI, no SI symbol exists) |
| Centrifugation | `rcf`, `rpm` |
| Temperature | `°C` |

When adding a new unit to one rule, check whether the other rules (magnitude-unit-spacing, range-style, thousands-separator) should also be updated.

**Known NIST SP 811 divergences.** The following are deliberate departures from NIST SP 811, documented here so they read as decisions rather than oversights:

| NIST rule | NIST says | Our style | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| §7.10.2 — percent | `25 %` (space before `%`) | `25%` | Universal convention; `25 %` reads as unusual to bench scientists |
| §7.10.3 — ppm/ppb/ppt | Not acceptable; use `µL/L` etc. | `ppm` permitted | Accessible shorthand; rarely appears in docs |
| Time abbreviations | `h`, `min`, `s`, `d` | `yr`, `mo` also used | Year and month have no SI symbol; `yr`/`mo` are the accepted non-SI forms |

### Spell checking (codespell)

**Run `codespell docs/` before opening a PR or committing content.** codespell catches real typos and enforces American English spelling.

```bash
codespell docs/          # check all docs
codespell <file.md>      # check a single file
```

Configuration lives in `.codespellrc` at the repo root. It uses the `en-GB_to_en-US` builtin dictionary, which flags British spellings as errors (`labelled` → `labeled`, `grey` → `gray`, `Acknowledgements` → `Acknowledgments`, `homogenous` → `homogeneous`). The `ignore-words = .codespell-ignore` option suppresses known false positives — add a **lowercased** word on its own line to suppress it (e.g., `ser` suppresses the amino acid abbreviation Ser which codespell misreads as a typo for "set").

codespell only flags words in its curated misspelling dictionary, so niche technical terms (`PURExpress`, `plamGFP`, `PURET7`) are not flagged.

### Link checking (lychee)

**Run `python3 scripts/check-links.py docs/` before opening a PR if you have added, edited, or removed any links or URLs.** Takes ~20 s for the whole corpus.

```bash
python3 scripts/check-links.py docs/          # both passes over all docs
python3 scripts/check-links.py <file.md>      # both passes, one file
python3 scripts/check-links.py --offline-only docs/   # internal links only, no network (~0.05 s)
```

The script wraps `lychee` and runs two passes: an **offline pass** over internal/relative links, and a **network pass** over external URLs. Exit codes are `0` (nothing blocking), `1` (broken links), `2` (the check could not run — e.g. lychee missing; distinct so tooling breakage isn't mistaken for broken docs).

**A failure is judged by what it says about the link, not by which vendor served it.** Do not add vendor domains or status codes to a suppression list — there isn't one, deliberately (issues #193, #199).

| Signal | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP 404 or 410 | **blocking** — the resource is gone |
| Hostname does not resolve | **blocking** — typo'd or dead domain |
| Relative/root-relative link resolves to no file | **blocking** — this 404s the deployed site |
| HTTP 401, 403, 429, any 5xx | tolerated, reported — crawler refused or server hiccup |
| Any other 4xx (400, 405, 406, 451…) | tolerated, reported — bot-shaped rejection |
| Timeout, TLS error, HTTP/2 reset, connection reset | tolerated, reported — says nothing about link validity |

Tolerated failures are normal and expected: a clean run currently reports ~120 of them (Sigma-Aldrich and Cytiva reset HTTP/2 connections; many vendors and `doi.org` return 403 to crawlers). **`✅ no broken links` alongside a long tolerated list is a pass.**

**Blame partitioning.** In CI the check runs with `--blame-changed <base-ref>`: external rot only blocks the PR if it's in a file the PR modified. Pre-existing rot elsewhere is reported under a "pre-existing broken link(s)" heading without failing the build, and is tracked by the weekly `link-rot` workflow, which keeps a single GitHub issue up to date. Internal-link failures block regardless of which files changed. Local runs omit the flag, so everything blocks.

**What it does not catch.** Staleness detection only works where a vendor returns an honest status code, so its reach is narrower than it looks:
- **Sigma-Aldrich and Cytiva never return one** — they reset the connection before any HTTP status. Between them that's ~40% of external links, and a discontinued part number there is undetectable at any frequency.
- **Soft-404s are invisible** — a vendor serving "product not found" with HTTP 200 reads as a healthy link.

Both still require manual review. `lychee` is pinned to 0.24.2 in both workflows because its JSON report is this script's input contract and has changed shape between releases before (#136); bump the pin and the local install together.

### DNA reference checking

**Run `python3 scripts/check-dna-refs.py` before opening a PR if you added or edited a Designs table** (any table with a `Length (bp)` / construct-name row linking into `nucleus-eng/DNA`). This is a different failure mode than link checking: a link can 404-free and still assert the wrong sequence — the motivating case was `reporter-degfp/spec.md` claiming 2789 bp for a construct that is actually 2812 bp after a correction in the DNA repo. `check-links.py` cannot see that; this script diffs the docs' bp claim against the target file's GenBank `LOCUS` line.

```bash
python3 scripts/check-dna-refs.py                       # all of docs/
python3 scripts/check-dna-refs.py docs/modules/<module>/ # one module
```

Local-only (reads `~/src/nucleus-eng/DNA` directly, or `$NUCLEUS_DNA_REPO`) — not run in CI, since CI has no DNA-repo checkout. Three levels: **blocking** (wrong bp, missing file, or a link into the legacy `bnext-bio/nucleus` repo — real errors), **warn** (construct name doesn't obviously relate to the target's `LOCUS` name or filename — often a benign alias, but exactly the shape of a greedy link, so confirm it's intentional before dismissing), **info** (nothing to verify — a `.dna` SnapGene file with no parseable length, or a row with no bp cell). It checks length, not sequence — a same-length, different-sequence swap is not detectable by this tool.

**Before opening a PR or committing content**, run Vale + codespell (and the link checker if you touched any URLs). Invoke the `lint-docs` skill for exact commands and how to interpret each tool's output — including which Vale errors are real vs. false positives.

### Pull request workflow

When merging a PR via `gh pr merge`, never use `--admin` to bypass branch protection rules. If a merge fails due to branch policy, stop and ask the developer how to proceed — options are leaving the PR open for a reviewer, asking the developer to approve it themselves, or using `--auto` to merge once requirements are met.
