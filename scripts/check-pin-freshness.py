"""Report quotes in staging files that were true when pinned and are not true now.

`check-pins.py` resolves a pinned citation against the tree it names. That can only
ever confirm it: a pin names an immutable tree, so a correctly-pinned claim that has
gone stale is indistinguishable from one that is current. The pin guarantees the quote
*was* true. Nothing checked whether it still describes the world.

This resolves the same quote twice -- at the pin and at the tip -- and reports only
where they differ.

  STALE   present at the pinned hash, absent at the tip   -> the claim has expired
  CASE    present at the tip but cased differently        -> quote it as written
  GONE    absent at both                                  -> the citation is wrong, not stale
  fresh   present at the tip                              -> nothing to do

STALE and GONE take opposite responses. STALE means re-read and rewrite; GONE means
retract. Without a hash the two are indistinguishable, which is why an unpinned quote
is reported as `nopin` rather than guessed at.

Matching is exact after whitespace normalisation, deliberately. A loose matcher turns a
verdict into a proxy, and a proxy is a prompt to go look rather than an answer. The one
softening is CASE, which is reported as its own status instead of being absorbed --
found 2026-09-17 when a quotation's lowercased initial reported identically to a real
miss.

Three stale-but-correct claims on 2026-09-17 are what this is for: two in the theory
corpus and one of ours, all accurate when written, all edited out afterwards.

**It resolves against LOCAL sibling checkouts, so it cannot see reachability.** A hash
that exists only in an unpushed local tree resolves here and 422s for everyone else;
a hash that is on the remote but not fetched here reports the opposite. The tool
answers *can I resolve this*, which is a different question from *can anyone*, and on
the machine that authored the commit the two look identical.

Measured 2026-09-19: twelve commits in this repo and one in `nucleus-skills` had never
been pushed, and four tracked files in `compositional-biology-theory` pinned to one of
them. This tool reported them fresh. It was correct and useless -- the pins were fine
on this disk and unresolvable from anywhere else.

`git ls-remote` or `git branch -r --contains` is the predicate that asks the reachable
question; `cat-file -e` is not, because it passes for exactly the person who needs
telling. Found by `compositional-biology-theory` session `c9d6a5`, whose own sweep
reported 37 of 37 pins resolving because `gh api` writes its error JSON to stdout and
the check tested for non-empty output rather than the exit code. **Branch on the exit
code.** This file does, at every call site -- which is why it has the local-tree blind
spot and not that one.

Wiring the reachable check needs the network and a fetched remote, so it is not done
here. The `staging` skill § Provenance states the rule: *the hash must be reachable by
the reader, not only by you.*

Moved to `nucleus-skills` 2026-09-21 from `nucleus-docs` `scripts/`. Two changes: the repo
and its staging glob are arguments, and the pointer above to a staging file that did not
exist is gone.
